This is the status report from 05.07.2021 to 18.07.2021.

Tasks for Mentee for these two weeks:
  - go through the code of an already existing plugin https://github.com/for-mainframe/For-Mainframe
  - solve the connection errors when connecting to the mainframe on Marist via plugin
  - look into possible ways to test the plugin

Results:
  - connection successful when using the version of the plugin from IntelliJ (plugin version 0.4.1). Connection not successful when using the version from 
    https://github.com/for-mainframe/For-Mainframe. It seems the GitHub repository might be for an older version.
  - Some features of the plugin, which are not much dependant on the server on mainframe might be tested using mockK
  - The recommended approach is to use model level functional tests, more here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/testing-plugins.html

Issues:
  - as stated in Results, there seems to be two versions of the code. Need to clarify this issue with the IBA.
  - it seems that the model level functional tests got stuck on a need to create mock-server which would mock the responses of the mainframe and the inability to
    connect from the version 0.2.
    
Possible path to resolve some of the issues:
  - look into mock-server: https://www.mock-server.com/
