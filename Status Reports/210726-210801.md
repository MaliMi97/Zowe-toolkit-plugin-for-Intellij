Tasks for the Mentee for this week:
  
  - Dive deeper into GH Actions


Results

  - Results of this and any subsequent research will be here: https://github.com/openmainframeproject-internship/Zowe-toolkit-plugin-for-Intellij/blob/master/Notes%20and%20Research/GitHub-actions.md

  - Attended a meeting about GH actions with an employee from GH.

Solved Issues:

  - The IBA finally sent a newer version of their code. There were some slight issues, but it is workable. Can be found here https://github.com/MaliMi97/For-Mainframe
    in the main branch. Commit 0.4.1 libs. Had to add r2z library, because the IBA is still working on the new one and so this preliminary version is not in mavencentral yet.
