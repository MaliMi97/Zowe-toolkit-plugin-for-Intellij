This is the status report from 19.07.2021 to 25.07.2021.


Tasks for the Mentee for these two weeks: 

  - Set up a testing pipeline using github actions Organise meeting with IBA 
      
      - Testing approach - unit, api and ui tests 
      
      - Clear up the matter with two versions of the code 
      
  - Set up a simple pipeline for testing on commits / pull requests using GitHub Actions


Results 

  - Meeting: 
  
    - For now unit and mainly api tests are more important. We should not focus on ui tests at the moment. 
  
    - IBA has a private repository with newer version of code. They want to perfect it and then they will upload it to the Zowe repository. 
  
    - IBA promised to provide newer (although not perfect) version of the code, so I can connect. 
  
  - Managed to set up a simple workflow, which tests the code on an event https://github.com/MaliMi97/For-Mainframe/blob/GHactions/.github/workflows/oneJob.yml

Issues: 

  - Waiting for code from IBA. 
  
  - The workflow runs the tests in sequence. Might be slow later on when tests (especially ui tests) are implemented. Try to test in parallel?
