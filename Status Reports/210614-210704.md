This is the status report from 14.6.2021 to 04.07.2021.

Tasks for Mentee for these three weeks:
  - Learn Kotlin as much as possible
  - Go through the code of an already existing plugin https://github.com/for-mainframe/For-Mainframe
  
Other tasks:
  - Get connection to mainframe in order to be able to test the plugin
  - Adjust the original working plan so that the already existing plugin is incorporated and we are not doing something that has already been done


Results:
  - The Mentee forked the already existing plugin here: https://github.com/MaliMi97/For-Mainframe, where he writes notes of the code
  - Got account on mainframe on Marist for both APIML and z/OSMF

Issues:
  - Problems with connecting to the mainframe via plugin. It seems there are problems with certificates.
